### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a mostly self-taught programmer that loves to tinker, program and do other nerdy stuff. I keep my resume up to date [here](https://github.com/aryan-gupta/CurriculumVitae-Resume/blob/master/Resume.pdf). I wish to go into the embedded, robotics, and machine learning field after I graduate from my masters in December of 2022.

<!-- I relized how wordy this below is on the main page. 
I recently graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and am currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Engineering. I expect to graduate in December of 2022. I am working at my university as an IT System Administrator and am working there as I have an agreement with my superiors that allows me to have my masterâ€™s degree paid for. I main interest is in embedded, robotics, and machine-learning.


My senior design project was the UNCCâ€™s NASA USLI (University Student Launch Initiative) competition. For this project, we designed a rocket that traveled 4000 ft into the atmosphere and deployed a drone (UAS) that would travel to a sample recovery area (SRA) to collect a 10 ml sample of simulated lunar ice and transport it away. My responsibilities included writing an application that will process the video taken from the rocket and locating the SRA site during its accent to apogee, writing embedded applications to control the servos and motors to deploy the UAS, and designing programs to autonomously control the flight of the UAS. I had to communicate my requirements to the Mechanical Engineers and work with the Electrical Engineers on the team to program and deploy the drone. We placed first place nationally in payload and second place nationally overall.


Currently for my graduate thesis, I am designing a reinforcement learning model for a path-finding agent. Even though this thesis is a work in progress, I am confident that I will be able to complete it by the time I graduate. I have extensive experience with C++ and loved programming in it, however recently I have started to use more python in my projects as it's easier to write prototypes and get proof-of-concepts quicker. I regularly practice my programming ability using Leet Code and personal projects. 

I have also extensive experience in other software development areas. In my early undergraduate career, I created a graphical game of the card game Gin Rummy. The code and assets for that project can be found [here](https://github.com/aryan-gupta/ginrummy). I also have created a graphical visualization of sorting algorithms similar to the viral [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/kPRA0W1kECg). This project can be found [here](https://github.com/aryan-gupta/VisualSorting). This project got me familiar with how sorting algorithms worked and better understand what was happening under-the-hood. Like this project, I created my own library that emulated the standard C++ data structures and algorithms. Some of the stand library like std::any are difficult to decipher as the library is written for speed and efficiency and not necessary in a way for beginners to understand. I decided to create my own version of the std:: library. It taught me how various data structures worked and more about templates and type-erasure in C++. The repository can be seen [here](https://github.com/aryan-gupta/libari). I have many more repositories that helped me develop my programming and technical experience, but I will end it here to reduce this introductionâ€™s wordiness.


My current position as an IT System Administrator II has provided me with the ability to network with various research faculty at my college. I have already worked with many of the faculty on research projects and helped them set up their computers and servers for their labs. Also, in my current position, I support many of the research Linux machines and servers for their work. Personally, I currently run over six hardware and VM-based machines running Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD in my ever-expanding home lab. Even though I live in an apartment that already has network infrastructure, I have sectioned off the network to accommodate my hobbies as a system administrator. I currently run Arch Linux as a daily driver for both my main desktop and laptop, both provisioned by Ansible. This work has allowed me to refine my troubleshooting, customer service, and Linux skills.

Outside of tech, I love going to the working out, going backpacking and biking and in the Appalachian trail. Most of my love for the outdoors comes from my childhood in Boy Scouts where we would go camping once every month. I am an eagle scout and I stayed around with my troop after I aged out as a Assistant Scoutmaster, I would definitely like to give back more, as its taught me so many things and prepared me for the life ahead of me.

As I am about to graduate, I am seeking a job in robotics and embedded system. If you are a recruiter, please send me an email using the email on the left and I would love to talk
